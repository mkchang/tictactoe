# Tic-Tac-Toe
A command line tic-tac-toe game for two players.

## Basic features

[x] Minimal UI that redraws the board and makes clear whose turn it is, each turn.
[x] Players can submit moves (assume, admittedly unrealistically, that both players are sitting at the same keyboard)
[x] Win detection - detect and display who won

## Bonus / stretch goals
[ ] Structure code such that the UI can be turned easily into a native mobile app (iOS say) without having to rewrite the core game logic
[ ] Implement win detection with a functional rather than iterative style
[ ] Between moves, rotate the board 90 degrees counter-clockwise. The moves "fall" due to "gravity", post-rotation
